# memory-card-TOP-project

After a short break, I'm back! The task seemed difficult to me, but in the end it turned out to be easier than I thought. I had a few questions that the guys on Discord helped me solve. I really enjoyed to do this task! Don't judge me for the quality of the pictures on the cards, I really was looking for normal quality :(

What was done:

1. Random generation of cards at page start.
2. Display score and best score.
3. The best score is saved and you won't lose it after page restart.
4. This time I styled the game and added some backgrounds, fonts, etc.
5. Added mobile support (21.09.2022)

What I used:
React, CSS, Hooks of course and NPM. Hmm... Looks like that's all.

Fonts i used:

1. Stanberry for text in the cards.
2. CashewCream for subtitle.
3. Get Schwifty for logo.
